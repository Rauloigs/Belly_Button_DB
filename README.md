# Belly_Button_DB
This Repository displays a Dashboard from a json file which has demographic information about bacterias in people. 
The intention of the DB is to visualize the Bacteria Samples in different ways in order to help a Beef Company to choose the best bacterias from people to put some taste into the meat. WoW! Take a look at this interactive DB.
